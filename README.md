# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I have used Vite + React to create this Sample cart page. I have used Context API to create Context and used the context for storing data. Context API prevents props drilling.
This is a cart page demonstrating those work.

Finally i have deployed the webpage using netlify, which is free, You could also visit their page if you want to know more.
